# Quick start
* If needed, install Java, Maven and Gradle. One of the easiest and most fexible
  way is to use [SDKMan](https://sdkman.io/), allowing to install any version of any
  JVM-based tool in parallel without interfering with the rest of the operating system.

* Build the Smithy model:
```bash
$ gradle build
```
