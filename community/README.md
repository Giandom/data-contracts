Data Contracts - Community management
=====================================

# Overview
[That page](https://github.com/data-engineering-helpers/data-contracts/blob/main/community/README.md)
helps to manage the community around the
[Data contracts initiative](https://github.com/data-engineering-helpers/data-contracts).

Data Contracts have the potential to reshape the organization in data teams
(_e.g._, I would not be surprised to see some departments named
"data contracts and governance" rather than just governance in the future).

This initiative aims at contributing to an open ecosystem (_i.e._,
open standards, open source tools and open knowledge sharing)
for the data contracts.

If you are interested in contributing, we can add yourself, and/or someone
from your team, as contributors of the
https://github.com/data-engineering-helpers GitHub public organization
(that way, you will will become contributors of the
https://github.com/data-engineering-helpers/data-contracts repository,
among others).

There have just been a few online meetings, mainly to see each other for real and present ourselves.

You are welcome there. There is of course no obligation. And there is no commitment either, from any of the parties. Our goal is just to exchange pieces of idea, of information, of knowledge, tips and tricks, so as to contribute to establish a de facto open standard around Data Contracts, avoiding proprietary lock-ins.

So far, we plan to use Open Data Mesh (ODM) as the open specification for Data Contracts (the main contributor being Andrea) and Schemata (Ananth being the main contributor) for the tooling/Swiss-knife.
A very early draft of the specifications of what we want to achieve is https://github.com/data-engineering-helpers/data-contracts#specifications

# Google Space
* Reference:
  [Google Space/Chat - Data Contracts Community](https://mail.google.com/chat#chat/space/AAAA15chWp0)
  (if you have no access to that Google Space, a community member has to invite
  you there)

The above-referenced Google Space/Chat is dedicated to knowledge sharing
and work planning for that open community (with the persons detailed
in the section below).

>**Note**
This initiative is not tight in any way to any cloud provider or any other
vendor. A few vendor-related members are interested to participate silently
(from a vendor perspective), that is, they absolutely do not interfere
in discussions with vendor-specific solutions.
